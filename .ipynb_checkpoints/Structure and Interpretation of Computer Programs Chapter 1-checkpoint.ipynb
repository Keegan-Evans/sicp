    "With small numbers, the original approach can prevent you from finding an even remotely accurate answer, as the absolute difference between a guess that is even many orders of magnitude from being right and the actual square root could be much smaller than the threshold(0.001 in this case). On the other hand, with very large numbers, by having a very small allowable difference between guesses, a much higher relative degree of accucuracy is \"required\" to indicate to the program that the correct answer has been found. This could lead to the program running out of memory before returning the \"correct\" answer, even if it has produced a result with a sufficient degree of accuracy. By making the evaluation \"relative\" to the size of the number, both of these issues are avoided. In the case of large numbers by allowing the program to run with a reasonable amount of resources and in the case of very small numbers with enough accuarcy to actually describe the square root of the number."
