# Keegan's Work Through of SICP

This is the place where I am keeping all of my work for Harold and
Ableson's classic **The Structure and Interpretation of Computer
Programs**. 

There will be a variety of files in here. Each chapter will have a
racket file that will hold definitions for the chapters and exercises.
Each chapter will also have a markdown file for chapter exercises and
occasional notes. Finally, I plan to create Anki flash cards using cloze
deletions for core concepts, patterns, algorithms, etc. This will
eventually be found in a single .txt file that can be imported into Anki.
